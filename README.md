# MScAML_group_project

## Steps to adding code:

  **1. Clone repository**

    git clone https://github.com/shreya-51/MScAML_group_project.git

  This command should create a directory that contains a copy of the MScAML_group_project repository on your local machine.

  **2. Create a branch**

    git branch <name of branch>

  **3. Switch to branch**

    git checkout <name of branch>

  After this command, you should see a message similar to "Switched to branch 'name_of_branch'".

  **4. Make code changes**

   At this point, you can make any code changes to the files in the cloned directory.

  **5. Commit changes**

    git add <path to file>

    git commit

  Then, add a descriptive message in the commit file that describes the code changes you made.

  **6. Push branch**

    git push

  Now your changes should be visible in the repository on GitHub.
